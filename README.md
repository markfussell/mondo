mondo
=====

Mondo was an object markup language (OML) that was trying to be simpler and more flexible than XML.  Effectively it was a more XML-like version of JSON but a bit better for textual content.

Note that the capital COM package prefix was actually the Sun/Javasoft defined standard back in the mid 1990s.
